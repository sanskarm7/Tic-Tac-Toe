# Tic Tac Toe

This Python script implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a player competes against the computer. The game utilizes a simple console-based interface and employs the minimax algorithm for the computer's moves. Players take turns to make their moves until a winner is determined or a stalemate is reached. The code provides an interactive experience and demonstrates the implementation of basic game logic.
